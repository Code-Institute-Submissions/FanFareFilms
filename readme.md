Outline

Readme Tasks:

  Write a README.md file for the web application that explains its purpose, the value that it provides to its users, and the deployment procedure.

  Insert screenshots of the finished project that align to relevant user stories

  Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.

Site Owner Goal
  Site Owner also owns a cinema - FanFare Films. Site Owner is looking for a website that firstly allows online bookings - for classic films that users can find details about on the website itself. These should be prominent and eye catching.
  Secondly - a voting system which allows returning users to vote for their next chosen classic, in order to drive repeat custom.

  The motivation is to draw custom and revenue to the venue, by facilitating online bookings and establishing interactivity from the end users. Make them feel invested.

  The films are the focus, instead of the venue. The venue is merely the site, the draw is the films.

Features to add:
  Date validation - currently using this week/next week. Calendar dropdown with valid dates available. Would be linked to a database of upcoming.
  Likely would go with something such as: https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

  Requires additional knowledge of JS and Jquery though appears achievable. Carepoints would include ensuring past bookings are not possible and only future bookings that fall on appropriate scheduled days.
